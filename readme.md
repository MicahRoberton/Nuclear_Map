# Nuclear Explosion Locations Map

**Author:** Micah Roberton

The webpage for the map can be accessed here: https://micahroberton.github.io/Nuclear_Map/

This map uses Leaflet to show nucleR explosion locations across the world from 1945-1998. Explosions that were delivered from an airdrop via plane are marked with a plane icon. Explosions that were buried underground and then detonated are marked by a down arrow. Finally explosions that were detonated in water are marked by a ship. The larger the bomb's max yield the more red the icon is.
